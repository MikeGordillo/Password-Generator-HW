# Password-Generator-HW
The HomeWork had some already written html and css
that looked like a Password Generator.
Our task was to use this existing code and using 
javaScript, to prompt the user with a series of criteria
questions, of which the answers will be used to generate said 
passwords. The criteria consists of length, between 8-128 characters,
Lowercase and uppercase and symbols. A password based on the answered
criteria should be generated.
Added some comments on the javaScript page as to understand the 
logic behind the code and to see how it interacts with the Html.
