# Password-Generator-HW
The HomeWork had some already written html and css
that looked like a Password Generator.
Our task was to use this existing code and using 
javaScript, to prompt the user with a series of criteria
questions, of which the answers will be used to generate said 
passwords. The criteria consists of length, between 8-128 characters,
Lowercase and uppercase and symbols. A password based on the answered
criteria should be generated.
